To tackle these problems, we'll need to break down the task into manageable parts. Let's start with the first part, which involves creating an environment for the modified Tic-Tac-Toe game and then training a reinforcement learning (RL) agent using TensorFlow Agents (TF-Agents). Here's an outline of the steps we need to follow:

Part 1: Basic Variation of Tic-Tac-Toe
Step 1: Define the Environment
State Space: Represents the 9x9 board. Each cell can be in one of three states: empty, occupied by nought, or occupied by cross.
Action Space: Consists of selecting any of the 81 squares.
Transition Dynamics: After selecting a square, there's a 1/2 chance the move is placed in the selected square. Otherwise, one of the 8 adjacent squares is randomly selected with a specific probability distribution, considering boundary conditions.
Rewards: A reward mechanism needs to be defined, usually giving positive points for a win, negative for a loss, and a smaller penalty or zero for non-terminal moves.
Step 2: Implement the Environment with TF-Agents
Use the PyEnvironment from TF-Agents to define the game dynamics.
Implement the _step method to handle the action execution and state transition, including the logic for the 1/2 chance of placement and the 1/16 chance for adjacent squares.
Implement the _reset method to reset the environment state for a new game.
Step 3: Train the RL Agent
Agent Selection: Choose an appropriate agent from TF-Agents, such as DQN (Deep Q-Networks), A2C (Advantage Actor-Critic), or PPO (Proximal Policy Optimization).
Policy and Network: Define the policy and network architecture suitable for handling the state and action space of our Tic-Tac-Toe game.
Training Loop: Implement the training loop, where the agent interacts with the environment, collects experience, and learns from it.
Part 2: Energy-Based Variation of Tic-Tac-Toe
Step 1: Modify the Environment to Include Energy
Extend the state space to also track the energy points of each player.
Adjust the action space to include the decision of how much energy to use on each move.
Step 2: Implement Energy Dynamics
Modify the transition dynamics to include the probability changes based on the energy used for a move.
Update the reward mechanism if necessary to consider energy usage strategies.
Step 3: Train the RL Agent with Energy Considerations
Adapt the agent's policy and network to account for the additional complexity of managing energy.
Ensure the training loop allows the agent to learn how to optimally use energy to maximize its chances of winning.
Implementation Notes
Complexity: These variations introduce significant complexity, especially with the probabilistic nature of move placements and the addition of energy points.
Experimentation: It may require extensive tuning of hyperparameters and network architectures to find an effective learning setup.
Simulation: Due to the randomness and the expanded state space, simulating a large number of games will be crucial for effective training.
Implementing these steps requires a solid understanding of TensorFlow, TF-Agents, reinforcement learning principles, and Python programming. If you're new to any of these areas, I recommend starting with tutorials or documentation on TensorFlow and TF-Agents to get a good grasp of the basics.
