Step 1: Define the Environment
We'll define a custom environment for the Tic-Tac-Toe game. This environment will inherit from tf_agents.environments.py_environment.PyEnvironment.
  import numpy as np
import tensorflow as tf
from tf_agents.environments import py_environment
from tf_agents.specs import array_spec
from tf_agents.trajectories import time_step as ts

class TicTacToeEnvironment(py_environment.PyEnvironment):
    def __init__(self):
        self._action_spec = array_spec.BoundedArraySpec(shape=(), dtype=np.int32, minimum=0, maximum=80, name='action')
        self._observation_spec = array_spec.BoundedArraySpec(shape=(9, 9), dtype=np.int32, minimum=0, maximum=2, name='observation')
        self._state = np.zeros((9, 9), dtype=np.int32)
        self._episode_ended = False

    def action_spec(self):
        return self._action_spec

    def observation_spec(self):
        return self._observation_spec

    def _reset(self):
        self._state = np.zeros((9, 9), dtype=np.int32)
        self._episode_ended = False
        return ts.restart(np.array(self._state, dtype=np.int32))

    def _step(self, action):
        if self._episode_ended:
            return self.reset()

        # Convert action into 2D coordinates
        row, col = divmod(action, 9)

        # Implement the game logic here, including the probabilistic placement of moves.
        # Update self._state accordingly.

        # Check if the game has ended and set self._episode_ended to True if so.
        # For simplicity, let's skip the win/draw check logic.

        # If the game has not ended, return a ts.transition
        # If the game has ended, return a ts.termination
        return ts.transition(np.array(self._state, dtype=np.int32), reward=1.0, discount=1.0)
Note:
This code sets up the environment with a 9x9 board.
The _step method needs to be completed with the logic for handling actions, including the probabilistic nature of move placements and checking for game termination conditions.
The reward and termination logic is highly simplified here and needs to be properly implemented based on the game's rules.
Next Steps:
Complete the Game Logic: Implement the specific rules for move placement, including the random selection of adjacent squares.
Define Rewards: Define how rewards are assigned for moves, wins, losses, and draws.
Agent Setup: Choose an RL algorithm (e.g., DQN, A2C, PPO) and define its network architecture.
Training Loop: Implement the loop where the agent interacts with the environment, learns from experiences, and improves its policy over time.
