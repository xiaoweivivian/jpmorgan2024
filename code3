  Notes on the Training Process:
Data Collection: The collect_step function collects data from the environment using the specified policy and adds it to the replay buffer. This process is crucial for gathering diverse experiences to train the agent.
Batching and Learning: The training loop samples batches of experiences from the replay buffer. These experiences are used to update the agent's neural network, minimizing the difference between predicted Q-values and the target Q-values derived from the Bellman equation.
Evaluation: Periodically, the performance of the agent is evaluated using a separate set of metrics. This is useful for monitoring the agent's learning progress over time.
