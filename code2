Completing the _step Method
Let's implement a simplified version of the probabilistic move logic inside the _step method. This version won't cover all edge cases or optimal strategies but will give you a solid starting point.
#
def _step(self, action):
    if self._episode_ended:
        return self.reset()

    # Convert action into 2D coordinates
    row, col = divmod(action, 9)

    if not (0 <= row < 9 and 0 <= col < 9) or self._state[row, col] != 0:
        # Invalid move
        self._episode_ended = True
        return ts.termination(np.array(self._state, dtype=np.int32), -1)

    # Attempt to place the move with a 1/2 chance
    if np.random.rand() < 0.5:
        self._state[row, col] = 1  # Assuming player 1
    else:
        # Select randomly among the 8 adjacent squares
        offsets = [(-1, -1), (-1, 0), (-1, 1), (0, -1), (0, 1), (1, -1), (1, 0), (1, 1)]
        np.random.shuffle(offsets)
        placed = False
        for dr, dc in offsets:
            new_row, new_col = row + dr, col + dc
            if 0 <= new_row < 9 and 0 <= new_col < 9 and self._state[new_row, new_col] == 0:
                self._state[new_row, new_col] = 1  # Assuming player 1
                placed = True
                break
        if not placed:
            # Move is forfeited if no adjacent square is valid
            pass

    # Simplified check for game end - implement win condition check here
    self._episode_ended = True  # Placeholder for actual game end check
    return ts.termination(np.array(self._state, dtype=np.int32), 1)

Setting Up a Training Loop with DQN
Now, let's outline how you would set up a DQN agent in TF-Agents to interact with this environment. This example assumes you have completed the necessary imports and installed TF-Agents.

#
from tf_agents.networks import q_network
from tf_agents.agents.dqn import dqn_agent
from tf_agents.utils import common
from tf_agents.environments import tf_py_environment
from tf_agents.replay_buffers import tf_uniform_replay_buffer
from tf_agents.trajectories import trajectory
from tf_agents.policies import random_tf_policy

# Convert the PyEnvironment to a TFEnvironment
train_env = tf_py_environment.TFPyEnvironment(TicTacToeEnvironment())
eval_env = tf_py_environment.TFPyEnvironment(TicTacToeEnvironment())

# Define a Q-Network
fc_layer_params = (100,)
q_net = q_network.QNetwork(
    train_env.observation_spec(),
    train_env.action_spec(),
    fc_layer_params=fc_layer_params)

# Instantiate the DQN agent
optimizer = tf.compat.v1.train.AdamOptimizer(learning_rate=1e-3)
train_step_counter = tf.Variable(0)
agent = dqn_agent.DqnAgent(
    train_env.time_step_spec(),
    train_env.action_spec(),
    q_network=q_net,
    optimizer=optimizer,
    td_errors_loss_fn=common.element_wise_squared_loss,
    train_step_counter=train_step_counter)
agent.initialize()

# (Optional) Setup policies here, e.g., for evaluation or exploration

# Setup a replay buffer
replay_buffer = tf_uniform_replay_buffer.TFUniformReplayBuffer(
    data_spec=agent.collect_data_spec,
    batch_size=train_env.batch_size,
    max_length=10000)

# Example function to collect steps
def collect_step(environment, policy, buffer):
    time_step = environment.current_time_step()
    action_step = policy.action(time_step)
    next_time_step = environment.step(action_step.action)
    traj = trajectory.from_transition(time_step, action_step, next_time_step)
    buffer.add_batch(traj)

# Collect initial data
for _ in range(100):  # Number of initial collection steps
    collect_step(train_env, random_tf_policy.RandomTFPolicy(train_env.time_step_spec(), train_env.action_spec()), replay_buffer)

# Training loop - this is a very simplified loop
# You would need to implement batching, learning triggers, evaluation, etc.
for _ in range(10000):  # Number of training steps
    # Implement actual training logic here
    pass
#
Implementation Notes:
This DQN setup is highly simplified. A real training loop would need careful handling of experiences, including batching and learning from the replay buffer.
The network architecture and hyperparameters (like learning rate) are placeholders. You'll need to experiment with these based on your specific problem.
The _step method in the environment and the training loop will likely need adjustments, especially to handle two-player logic and the specifics of your probabilistic move rules.
